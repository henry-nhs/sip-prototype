          <p>
              When you register with NHS Test and Trace, you will be legally required to self-isolate. You must not leave home for any reason other than a genuine emergency – for example, to seek medical care or to escape harm. If you do not comply, you may face a penalty of at least £1,000 or prosecution and a fine.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are advised:
            </p>

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>
                not to have visitors in your home, including friends and family – except for essential care
              </li>
              <li>
                to try to avoid contact with anyone you live with as much as possible
              </li>
              <li>
                to order food or medicine online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off at your home
              </li>
            </ul>
  
            <p>
              If you do not have symptoms:

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
