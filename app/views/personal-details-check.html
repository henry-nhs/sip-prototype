          <p>
            When you register with NHS Test and Trace, you will be legally required to self-isolate. This means you must:
          </p>

          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              not leave your home for any reason – if you need food or medicine, order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off at your home
            </li>
            <li>
              not have visitors in your home, including friends and family – except for essential care
            </li>
            <li>
              try to avoid contact with anyone you live with as much as possible
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you do not have symptoms:
          </p>

          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              people you live with do not need to self-isolate
            </li>
            <li>
              people in your support bubble do not need to self-isolate
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you do not comply, you may face a penalty of at least £1,000.</p>
          
          <p>The app still cannot be used to track you.</p>
