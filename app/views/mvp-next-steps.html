          You have not applied for the Test and Trace Support Payment yet. To do this, you will need to complete the following steps.
        </p>

        <div class="nhsuk-do-dont-list sip-info-card">
            <h2 class="nhsuk-do-dont-list__label">{{step3Label}}</h2>
            <div class="nhs-sip-text-with-icon nhs-sip-email-icon">
                <p>
                  NHS Test and Trace will send you an email and text message.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Emails and texts are sent between 7.30am and 8:30pm, and can take up to an hour to come through. If you submitted your details after 8:30pm, you will receive the email and text the following morning. 
                </p>
            </div>
            {{ insetText({
              "HTML": "<p>
              If you cannot find the email, you should check your junk mail or spam folder.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do not receive an email or text within 24 hours, call 119.
            </p>"
            }) }}
            <p>
              Before you can apply for the payment, you will need to:
            </p>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>
                follow the link to enter some personal details
              </li>
              <li>
                take note of your NHS Test and Trace Account ID, which you will need for the next step
              </li>
            </ul> 
        </div>

        <div class="nhsuk-do-dont-list sip-info-card">
          <h2 class="nhsuk-do-dont-list__label">{{step4Label}}</h2>
          <p>
            After you have completed the steps above, you should receive a second email or text message from NHS Test and Trace. When this has arrived, you can apply for the payment from your local authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find the application form on your local authority’s website by using this link: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/test-and-trace-support-payment">https://www.gov.uk/test-and-trace-support-payment</a>. Make a note of this so you can return to it later.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of your application, you will need to enter your NHS Test and Trace Account ID. This is the 8-digit number included in the email and text message from NHS Test and Trace. Your local authority may call this something different, such as an account number or CTAS number.
          </p>

          <p>
            They will ask you for information, including:
          </p>

          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              proof of your identity
            </li>
            <li>
              proof of benefits you’ve received
            </li>
            <li>
              your employment details (including National Insurance number)
            </li>
            <li>
              your bank account details
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
