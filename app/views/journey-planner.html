        <p>To apply for this payment, you will need to complete the following steps.</p>

        <div class="nhsuk-do-dont-list sip-info-card">
            <h2 class="nhsuk-do-dont-list__label">1. {{step1Label}}</h2>
            <p>Log in or register for an NHS account so we can check who you are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="nhsuk-do-dont-list sip-info-card">
            <h2 class="nhsuk-do-dont-list__label">2. {{step2Label}}</h2>
            <p>You will be asked to enter your name and postcode, so that NHS Test and Trace can check for duplicate applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="nhsuk-do-dont-list sip-info-card">
            <h2 class="nhsuk-do-dont-list__label">3. {{step3Label}}</h2>
            <p>
                You will receive an email and text message from NHS Test and Trace (this usually takes around 30 minutes).
            </p>
            <p>
                You will need to enter some personal details to register for NHS Test and Trace if you haven’t already done this.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you’ve registered, you’ll receive an account number (sometimes known as a CTAS number).
            </p>
        </div>

            <p>You’ll receive a link to your local authority’s website.</p>
            <p>Your local authority will ask you for your NHS Test and Trace ID - the 8-digit number you receive when you have registered with NHS Test and Trace. Your local authority may call this something slightly different, such as an account number or CTAS number.</p>
            <p>They will also ask you for at least:</p>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>
                    proof of your identity

                <li>
                    proof of benefits you’ve received
                </li>
                <li>
                    your employment details (including National Insurance number)
                </li>
                <li>
                    your bank account details
